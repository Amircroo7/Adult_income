# Machine Learning
- My project focused on predicting adult income levels using classification models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with using SKLearn library. To evaluate the performance of these models, we used various metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. By comparing the results, I was able to identify the most effective model for predicting income levels and gain insights into the key factors that contribute to income classification.
